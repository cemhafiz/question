This repository is created for the solution and the explanation of a question and linked to git with a ssh key.

The suggested "question" is more like a challenge, a challenge for writing a python script which takes an input from the user and detecting the longest substring(s) in 
the given input without duplicate characters.

I believe this is a pretty useful exercise for studying python.
